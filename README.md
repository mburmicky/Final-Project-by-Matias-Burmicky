### `Question to work on`

#### In this exercise, I would like to predict which customer are likely to churn and their churn score. Then understand for those staying, what initiatives can be built to retain them in the future

### `About the data sets`

***`Data sets collected manually`***

***Overall*** 

#### The data sets are about a fictional telecom company that has information about their customers, and if they have churned or not based on a variety of possible factors.
